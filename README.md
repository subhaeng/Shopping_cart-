# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

ðŸ›’ Shopping Cart - MyDxO Shop
Introduction

The Shopping Cart Project (MyDxO Shop) is a simple yet functional e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, view details, and add items to their shopping cart. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for online shopping while demonstrating key concepts of modern web development such as state management, dynamic rendering, and interactive UI design.

This project was built with the goal of understanding how an online store works at its coreâ€”covering features like:

Displaying a product catalog with images, titles, descriptions, and prices

Adding and removing products from the shopping cart

Keeping track of total items in the cart

A clean and responsive design for better user experience

The project can be extended into a full-fledged e-commerce platform with features like checkout, authentication, payment integration, and order management.
